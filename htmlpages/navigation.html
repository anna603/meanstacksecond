  Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.
  Examples
  
  Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the eight required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline dismissal, use the alerts jQuery plugin.
  A simple primary alert—check it out!
  A simple secondary alert—check it out!
  A simple success alert—check it out!
  A simple danger alert—check it out!
  A simple warning alert—check it out!
  A simple info alert—check it out!
  A simple light alert—check it out!
  A simple dark alert—check it out!
  Carousel
  
  A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text—like a carousel.
  How it works
  
  The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.
  
  In browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is minimized, etc.).
  
  The animation effect of this component is dependent on the prefers-reduced-motion media query. See the reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation.
  
  Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are generally not compliant with accessibility standards.
  
  Lastly, if you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js.
  Example
  
  Carousels don’t automatically normalize slide dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional utilities or custom styles to appropriately size content. While carousels support previous/next controls and indicators, they’re not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit.
  
  The .active class needs to be added to one of the slides otherwise the carousel will not be visible. Also be sure to set a unique id on the .carousel for optional controls, especially if you’re using multiple carousels on a single page. Control and indicator elements must have a data-target attribute (or href for links) that matches the id of the .carousel element.
  Slides only
  
  Here’s a carousel with slides only. Note the presence of the .d-block and .w-100 on carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.
